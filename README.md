As you can see in the screen shots the user is given a dropdown menu to select the state or territory that they would like to see the covid-19 related stats for.
When they click "Go" the search results produces, positive and negative test rates, the number of deaths, the Rt - the rate the virus spreads, and the ratio of 
positive tests results. This app offers an easy and simple way to view statistics around covid-19 pandemic. 

I would also like to add more data points, like the number of people recovered, and allow users to drill down into more specific areas, such as city, county, and
school district. In adding graphs and maps that will give the user an additional way to understand the data that they are searching for.
